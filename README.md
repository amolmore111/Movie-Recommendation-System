# Movie-Recommendation-System

The Movie Recommendation System Project is an endeavor to create a personalized movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. 
This project leverages collaborative filtering techniques and is presented through a user-friendly web application built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web interfaces.

# Objective

The primary goal of the Movie Recommendation System Project is to provide users with movie recommendations tailored to their individual tastes. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, the system aims to enhance user engagement and satisfaction by suggesting movies they are likely to enjoy.

# Methodology

# Data Collection: 
The project begins by collecting a dataset of movies and user ratings. This dataset typically includes information such as movie titles, genres, and user ratings.

# Data Preprocessing: 
Data preprocessing involves cleaning and organizing the dataset. This step may include handling missing values, transforming data into a suitable format, and encoding categorical variables.

# Collaborative Filtering: 
Collaborative filtering is the core recommendation technique used in this project. It works by identifying users with similar movie preferences and recommending movies that those similar users have liked. Two common collaborative filtering methods are user-based and item-based filtering.

# Web Application Development: 
The recommendation system is presented to users through a web application built using Streamlit. Users can input their preferences, view movie recommendations, and interact with the system.

# Recommendation Display: 
The recommended movies are displayed to the users along with relevant information such as movie posters, titles, and descriptions. Users can also provide feedback on the recommendations to improve future suggestions.

# User Feedback Integration: 
The system collects user feedback on recommended movies, which is used to continuously refine the recommendation algorithm and improve the accuracy of future suggestions.

# Tools and Libraries

# Streamlit: 
Streamlit is used to develop the web application, providing a user-friendly interface for inputting preferences and displaying movie recommendations.

# Pandas: 
Pandas is utilized for data manipulation and preprocessing, enabling efficient handling of the movie dataset.

# Scikit-learn: 
Scikit-learn is employed for collaborative filtering algorithms and recommendation model development.

# Matplotlib and Seaborn: 
These libraries are used for data visualization, presenting insights into the user's movie preferences.

# Conclusion
The Movie Recommendation System Project successfully accomplishes its objective of providing personalized movie recommendations to users. 
By combining collaborative filtering techniques with an interactive web application built using Streamlit, it creates a user-friendly and engaging experience for movie enthusiasts.
